### ORM Middleware Showcase

### Using NodeJS, Express, Postgresql this small project aims to illustrate the relationship between API endpoints, the data layer service functions and the actual data base. 

#### There are two primary branches, main & knex.

Main branch has my own written functions to handle the data layer instead of knex.

The knex branch utilises the knex library to abstract this.

**Install instructions**
1. Pull the repo down
2. npm i
3. npm run dev
4. Ensure postgres is installed on your local machine and is running
5. Using postman, hit any of the endpoints with the correct JSON data payloads and you should see responses in postman.
